title:  What Does the TikTok Deal Mean For the Future Of Software?
author: Adam Berg

When you think about computers, software, and the Internet, a cornucopia of American tech companies is probably what comes to mind.  Until recently, the market has been controlled by players like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon.  Unsurprisingly, the rest of the world has caught on and it's time to address what global software development is going to look like.  In this post I'll dive in to the notorious TikTok deal that's in progress, while also pondering what this means for international software development.

## If You Can't Beat Them, Buy Them

This story isn't complete without a brief reminder of the other major tech story that is unfolding in the background.  On July 29, 2020, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google executives testified at a House hearing over antitrust concerns.  Large chunks of that hearing were hijacked over concerns about censorship - certainly a concern, but not the allegation that is being leveled.  The hearing concluded with an ominous sounding message, that was clearly written before the hearing even began.  The message seems clear, the current government officials (on both sides of the aisle) think these companies have too much power. [1]

Fast-forward to today, where we have now seen at least two major power moves from the government.  Upon closer inspection, I'm starting to wonder if this is an indirect way of leveling the playing field.  The first is the $10 billion cloud computing contract the Pentagon gave to Microsoft [3]. Amazon's AWS is currently the market leader here and, at least anecdotaly, seems to have won the hearts of developers.  How a decision like this is made, I'll probably never know, but Amazon's complaint of interference seems at least somewhat valid.

The second power move is the main topic at hand.

## Trump's TikTok Deal

On July 7, 2020 Mike Pompeo announce the goverment was considering banning TikTok citing national security concerns.  By July 31, 2020, President Trump threatened to shut down U.S. operations if ByteDance didn't divest ownership of the application.  Microsoft rose as a contender to purchase the U.S. operations, but ultimately that deal was rejected by ByteDance.  Despite imminent threats of being pulled from the app stores, it looks like we've reached a deal where Oracle and Walmart will purchase a majority stake.

I personally still don't have a clear understanding of why this was done and am less clear on the precedent that this potentially sets.  If there is concern about Americans using a Chinese owned application, that concern doesn't end with TikTok.  A federal judge has already blocked a similar ban on WeChat, arguing that banning it violated the American's First Amendment rights.  We have yet to get regulation of American tech companies under control, and now we've set sights on Chinese companies.

## Quick Detour to GDPR

I've dived through the depths of GDPR a couple of times now.  I will not pretend to be an expert on it, but I at least somewhat grasp what it's attempting to achieve.  Despite being a royal pain in the neck, it is a legitimate attempt to put legislation that protects members of the European Union.  In doing so, they have unintentionally crafted what is effectively an international policy, as most software companies will likely treat all customers the same.  Therefore, in order to comply with GDPR, they end up complying with GDPR across their entire customer base.

If data protection is the problem we are trying to solve, then there is a much larger conversation we should be having.  Today it's TikTok, but tomorrow it will be something else.
