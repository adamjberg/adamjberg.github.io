NeuroTribes, by Steve Silberman, takes the reader on a historical journey of autism since the 18th century. I stumbled on this book after watching both of Hannah Gadsby's Netflix Comedy specials (*Douglas* and *Nanette*).  In both of them, she discusses her Autism diagnosis and how it affects her life.  This wasn't the first thing I watched about autism that I related to.  The previous year I stumbled upon Temple Grandin and her [presentations on autism](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=temple+grandin+TED).  Autism is widely known to be prevelant in the software industry, so whether I have it or not I am likely to be exposed to it. I believe it is important to understand so that I can understand others and myself.  

## Autism as a Spectrum

We didn't always consider autism a spectrum. You are likely familiar with the term "aspergers", which if you are the average person, you might define as "similar to autism but not as bad". I thought this was the extent of the confusion, but there was also  pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD).  

### Brief History of the DSM

The “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” (DSM) is the manual used in the United States that lays this all out. It was preceded by the American Psychiatric Assiciation Manual (1917) which was laid out in response to national [census data that started being collecting in 1840](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1840_United_States_Census).  

The U.S. population at the time was around 17 million (2.5 million were slaves).  The census asked for "number of insane and idiotic in public or private charge, by race".  Nearly all slaves were marked as mentally ill and pro-slavery advocates used this as evidence of the consequences of emancipation.  A more logical conclusion was provided by John Quincy Adams that the census demonstrated "a multitide of gross and important errors".

| DSM | Year |
|-----|------|
| I   | 1952 |
| II  | 1968 |
| III | 1980 |
| IV  | 1994 |
| V   | 2013 |

It wasn't until the most recent DSM V that the four categories of autism mentioned above were consildated into an umbrella diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.  Despite covering the main names behind autism in great detail: [Leo Kanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Kanner), [Hans Aspberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Asperger), and [Lorna Wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorna_Wing), I found the timeline difficult to follow.  Despite performing his research at the same time as Leo Kanner (1940s), Aspberger's Syndrome didn't find it's way in to the DSM until DSM-IV, thanks to Lorna Wing resurfacing Aspberger's work.

### Quantum Mechanics: An Idea in Two Places at the Same Time

I always struggle to keep dates straight when there are too many of them.  Below lays out the the timeline of Kanner and Asperger's research.

| Year | Major Event                        |
|------|------------------------------------|
| 1911 | Physician, schoolteacher, and social reformer Erwin Lazar opens Children's Clinic where Asperger eventually works
| 1924 | Leo Kanner moves to US from Berlin after graduating from medical degree (cardiology)
| 1927 | Georg Frankl starts working in the Children's Clinic
| 1930 | Leo Kanner helps establish the Children's Psychiatry Service at the Harriet Lane Home at Johns Hopkins
| 1931 | Asperger earns medical degree from University of Vienna
| 1935 | Kanner publishes *Child Psychiatry*. This was the first English language textbook for child psychiatry.
| 1937 | Kanner hired Georg Frankl, Aspberger's chief diagnostician
| 1938 | Kanner starts observing 11 patients in preparation for "Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact"
| 1938 | Aspberger gives first public talk on autism in history
| 1939 | World War II Starts
| 1943 | Kanner publishes landmark paper "Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact"
| 1944 | Asperger publishes landmark paper describing autistic symptoms
| 1945 | World War II Ends
| 1994 | Asperger's Syndrome added to DSM-IV

One interesting part of this story, is that Kanner denies having any knowledge of Asperger's work.  Silberman frequently alludes to this, but refrains from boldy declaring that Kanner was avoiding mentioning Aspberger so he could take all the credit.  The hiring of Georg Frankl is presented as evidence that there is no way Kanner wasn't aware of Aspberger's existence.

Another important piece of the puzzle is framing the discovery of autism in the context of World War II.  Kanner and Asperger were just starting to get down to business when the world erupted in to war.  Asperger served as a medical officer in the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia.  Near the end of the war, a school Aspberger opened to help the children he was seeing was bombed, destroying it and much of Aspberger's early work. In Maryland, Kanner was busy rescuing hundreds of Jewish physicians by helping them relocate to the United States and housing them.

## Eugenics and the Rise of Hitler

Eugenics is a term that I don't think I learned until after high school. I'll admit to not paying the best attention in history class, but this seems like a huge topic that one wouldn't really forget.  I was surprised to find a large section of the book devoted to talking about it.  This ended up being my crash course on eugenics (a topic I intend to look in to further).

The topic of eugenics comes up in regards to all different kinds of mental illness.  This is a huge topic, but I'll stick to what Silberman discusses.  The modern definition of eugenics was coined by Charle Darwin's half cousin Francis Galton in 1887.  The word loosely means "the good birth".  Hot off the heels of Darwin's *On the Origin of Species*, the movement was focused on conscious evolution.  The belief that by controlling who was reproducing (via euthanasia and forced sterilazation), the genetic quality of humans could be improved.  It is closely tied to scientific racism and white supremacism.

In the midst of World War II, Asperger was attempting to submit his thesis to a university that Nazis had removed the majority of medical faculty and replaced with "bumbling fanatics".  The following lines by Silberman introduced a concept that my American schooling never would have dared to suggest:

> Asperger was speaking out with the "force of his whole personality" for the sake of children all over Europe who had not yet been murdered by a monstrous idea of human perfectability - an idea that his supervisors, who were fervent Nazis, had imported from America.

| Year | Major Event                        |
|------|------------------------------------|
| 1912 | The First International Eugenics Congress in **London**
| 1915 | Second KKK Founded
| 1916 | *The Passing of the Great Race* published by **American** eugenicist Madison Grant
| 1921 | The Second  International Eugenics Congress in **New York**
| 1923 | [Beer Hall Putsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch) Puts Hitler in Landsberg
| 1924 | Hitler Released from Landsberg
| 1925 | Hitler publishes Mein Kampf
| 1932 | The Third  International Eugenics Congress in **New York**
| 1933 | Hitler appointed as Chancellor of Germany
| 1933 | Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring **Germany**
| 1939 | Aktion T-4 - physicians were authorised to select patients "deemed incurably sick, after most critical medical examination" and then administer to them a "mercy death"
| 1941 | The Holocaust

Eugenics policies were first implemented in the early 1900s in the United States, where sterilization of thousands (predominantly non-white) began.  Many of the big names of the time were in support of eugenics: Winston Churchill believed that eugenics could solve "race deterioration" and reduce crime and poverty. Alexander Graham Bell was honorary president of the second eugenics conference.  The American movement received extensive funding from the Carnegie Institution and Rockefeller Foundation.

Hitler wrote to Grant, the author of *The Passing of the Great Race*, thanking him for the book and referred to it as "my Bible". In 1919 he joined the German Workers' Party. It seems likely that his interest in the eugenics movement motivated him to get involved in politics.  While most of the blame tends to be focused on him as an indvidual, it would be ignorant to not recognize that there was a large following that agreed with the message he was heading.
