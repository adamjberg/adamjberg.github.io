Out of curiosity I [googled](https://www.google.com/search?q=opinions+about+opinions) this title and the third result was a [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-on-opinions) page.  With 35 answers there, I suspect I will be able to find the spectrum of opinions on opinions.


## [Opinion 1: Science > Opinion](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-on-opinions/answer/Krishna-KumariChalla)

Ph.D. Founder, Science Communication Network at Sci-Art Lab

> In my world of science, opinions don’t count much. So I stopped taking them seriously.
> When something is based on peoples’ perception and not reality, why should I even bother about their biases, strange interpretations, conditioning of their minds, emotions, ignorance and beliefs?
> I just play with them for a brief period to understand people around, and then move on.

## [Opinion 2: Opinions Are Harmful](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-on-opinions/answer/Melissa-Myer-1)

Employed at The University of Texas at Austin

> My opinion is that far too many people use their opinions in a flimsy attempt to legitimize and promote false information. In the long run, this hurts people. You don’t need health insurance. Marriage is just a piece of paper. Everyone should own a home. All of these statements are opinions, and they are so patently wrong that they cannot even be prefaced with “It is my opinion that …”

## [Opinion 3: Opinions Are Valuable](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-on-opinions/answer/Gerard-Cec)

Philosophy and diploma in counselling and every day life

> Peoples opinions are very valuable, we can learn by them. There is no such thing as a bad one. Opinions disclose the person, their thoughts and wishes. Only those less versed in people will argue with those opinions.

Worth mentioning the below is embedded in a picture a la those inspirational quotes.

## [Opinion 5: I Have Them, But They Might be Wrong](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-on-opinions/answer/Tommy-C-Lim-Jr)

Founder, COO, Senior Software Engineer at QBRYX Technology Solutions

> Opinions are generally unnecessary. They also cause a lot of problems when they are regarded as fact.
> I often will tell people that something is “only my opinion/speculation and not to regard it as fact” that’s because I’m very open to my opinions and speculations being wrong. I don’t hold strongly to them. I use them only to guide strategy and change strategies whenever the opinions are wrong.

## [Opinion 6: People Only Care About Their Own Opinions](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-on-opinions/answer/Steven-Ussery)

66-year-old husband, grandfather, and amateur philosopher

>First, that everybody has one, including me. Second, that most people want you to know their opinion but they don’t want to know yours. Third, most of the opinions I hear are naive and not well thought through. They mostly amount to what a person wanted to believe in the first place. Fourth, all of the above are opinions.

Worthless -> Useful
For select few -> For All
Sharing -> Listening
Dangerous -> Harmless
Attack -> Respect
Acknowledge not fact -> Presented as fact
