Coming up with app ideas is one of my favorite things to do. I have countless drawings and doodles of apps that do all kinds of things. Truthfully, almost none of them have seen the light of day. I work a full time as a software engineer, so coming home and plugging away another several hours at a computer is challenging to muster at the best of times. This idea, however, won't seem to go away. I won't fully commit to actually building it, but if I start laying out what needs to get built inevitably my future self will slowly chip away at it.

With a limited amount of time, I'm looking for the smallest possible thing that can be built that I can start using and go from there. As mentioned in my previous post, a daily journal is probably the simplest use case for something that I would use. Let's try to narrow that down a bit with some user stories.

As a user, I can create a new text daily journal entry
~~As a user, I can view previous daily journal entries~~
~~As a user, I can delete daily journal entries~~

This sounds pretty simple so far, but there are lots of small details to figure out. There is potentially a restriction that each day only has one journal entry. When trying to find a historic journal entry, one way might be to select using a calendar. However, you may not know when you wrote the thing you are looking for, you just know "I wrote this in the last couple of days". In this case, having a scrollable list with the current day at the top might be preferable. 

One of my original goals was to reduce as much friction as possible when trying to add information to the current days journal entry. If I open the app, I don't want to be brought to a list of entries to select the current day, I would like to be immediately brought to where I left off.  

Another goal was to ensure that this is accessible on a phone. There may be things we could add to the desktop side of things later, but I plan to use this primarily daily on the phone and so we should start there.

Judging by my current behaviour, I don't often actually look back on old journal entries. The act of writing things down is where I find most of the benefit. This means that I can afford to make finding older entries a bunch more difficult in order to stick to the primary goal of making writing new information as streamlined as possible.

My first thought is to start with only one type of page. This should save some initial time as I can ignore routing and navigation and focus on just the one page. The page is dead simple. At the top it shows what day I am currently on and below is a text field waiting for my input. Autosaving is probably ideal, but also could be a hassle to build.  To keep things simple, there will be a giant save button at the bottom.

To view other journal entries, I'm thinking the edge of the page can be tapped to navigate. This keeps the UI free of buttons ensuring that the only thing your mind is focusing on is the text on the page.

I originally made deleting the entry a requirement, but decided that it doesn't seem necessary for what I am testing. My goal is to write an entry for every day, and even if I miss one I may want an empty record to backfill.

The above is what I would loosely describe as a Feature Brief. Now that we have a sense of what the UI will look like it's time to plan out the technical side of things with a Technical Brief.

This project is starting from scratch so there are quite a few initial decisions to make. There are way too many options to list for how this could be built, but for simplicity it will follow a tech stack that I know reasonably well: MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node). If this does actually get built, I can use it to discuss some of the more advanced aspects of each of these. Ultimately, I expect that most technical I write will be related to the MERN stack.

In part one of this story, I played the user. Hopeless and lost trying to find an app that meets my needs. Above I played the Product Owner. Having heard the customer's gripes I attempted to craft a solution the the user's problems. Now I put on the software engineer hat and figure out how to make this a reality.

The first hitch that comes to mind is how secure we would like this information to be. As currently described, there is no authentication. If the above design is built and deployed it would be visible to anyone with the URL. I would like to use this app as my actual daily journal, which likely will contain information that I don't want the world to have access to. 

I see two main options for how to proceed (there are probably several more). I can increase the scope of this project and add some kind of login process or I could accept that at least initially my notes may be viewable if someone had access to the URL. As the person that actually has to build this, I want to figure out how to do as little work as possible. More work = more time = never actually happening.

With these goals in mind, I propose a compromise. Our user (me) is primarily concerned with having the easiest way to add and edit a daily entry. I have expressed that I don't often actually look at old ones. If we drop the user story to view previous journal entries, then even if the website is public, the most someone could see is the entry from the current day. I don't plan on immediately sharing where this gets deployed, so I am ok with that level of "risk". 

We're now down to just one user story that focuses on the specific thing I am looking for out of this app. I started with what I thought was an MVP, but have found that there's even more fat that could be trimmed off. 

Let's break down how the UI will be built. There's the date at the top of the page, an editable text box below, and finally a save button at the bottom. If this were a larger project, I would advocate to split each of these in to it's own component. However, in this case we're just trying things out. The save button might get nixed, the overhead of creating multiple components, and crafting a folder structure are all reasons why that's probably unnecessary at this stage.

It's all going to get plopped right in to our App component provided by create-react-app. As new requirements and changes come along, the architectural decisions can be factored in then.

The date will need some specific styling to get centered, bolded, and sized. This will also get dumped straight in to the index.css provided by create-react-app.

The textarea element should fill the rest of the height up to the save button at the bottom. We will need to set the overflow-y, height, and resize properties on the text area in order to get the behaviour we're looking for.

Finally, the save button will be a simple div with a background-color set and centered text inside. The onClick event will be hooked up to send the current journal entry to the backend.

Our web app needs to be able to do two things: fetch or update the current day's entry. We will create a GET route for the fetch and a POST route for the update. One of the other crucial areas I've skipped so far is data storage. The journal entries will be stored in a Mongo database (likely the free shared cluster on MongoDB Atlas). The schema will include _id, date, and body properties. The date field will be a string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" to avoid wonky timezone issues. 

Similar to the frontend, I will avoid imposing much architecture or folder structure to this code. It should be a small enough set of code to get an express server up running, a MongoDB connection opened, and two simple express routes created.
