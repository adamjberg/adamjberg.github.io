The last few years I have found myself increasingly interested in Artificial Intelligence.  Part of the interest stems from simply just wanting to learn something new.  The other part of me can see real world applications that we've barely scratched the surface of. 

Tonight I had some free time and as usual I had too many ideas for what I wanted to actually accomplish. I have several pages worth of things I want to do, which means it's usually overwhelming to pick one and actually see it through.  The other day  I stumbled on an interesting situation that played out on the blogosphere.  Someone used [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) to generate a [moderately successful blog](https://liamp.substack.com/p/my-gpt-3-blog-got-26-thousand-visitors).  

I read [one of the articles](https://adolos.substack.com/p/feeling-unproductive-maybe-you-should) to see what all the fuss was about.  I have mixed opinions about the results.  I'm genuinely surprised that it is able to generate such coherent text.  Then I started to think about how it could craft something like this, and wondered if it was effectively just plagarizing some existing post.  After googling a few phrases, none of them turned up results that weren't the original post.  It would be interesting to dive deeper in to how it works and what source material it's been training on.  

This situation reminded me of a hypothetical situation raised in Life 3.0 by Steven Pinker.
