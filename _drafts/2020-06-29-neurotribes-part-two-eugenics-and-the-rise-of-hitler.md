Eugenics is a term that I don't think I learned until after high school. I'll admit to not paying the best attention in history class, but this seems like a huge topic that one wouldn't really forget.  I was surprised to find a large section of the book devoted to talking about it.  This ended up being my crash course on eugenics (a topic I intend to look in to further).

The topic of eugenics comes up in regards to all different kinds of mental illness.  This is a huge topic, but I'll stick to what Silberman discusses.  The modern definition of eugenics was coined by Charle Darwin's half cousin Francis Galton in 1887.  The word loosely means "the good birth".  Hot off the heels of Darwin's *On the Origin of Species*, the movement was focused on conscious evolution.  The belief that by controlling who was reproducing (via euthanasia and forced sterilazation), the genetic quality of humans could be improved.  It is closely tied to scientific racism and white supremacism.

In the midst of World War II, Asperger was attempting to submit his thesis to a university that Nazis had removed the majority of medical faculty and replaced with "bumbling fanatics".  The following lines by Silberman introduced a concept that my American schooling never would have dared to suggest:

> Asperger was speaking out with the "force of his whole personality" for the sake of children all over Europe who had not yet been murdered by a monstrous idea of human perfectability - an idea that his supervisors, who were fervent Nazis, had imported from America.

Eugenics policies were first implemented in the early 1900s in the United States, where sterilization of thousands (predominantly non-white) began.  Many of the big names of the time were in support of eugenics: Winston Churchill believed that eugenics could solve "race deterioration" and reduce crime and poverty. Alexander Graham Bell was honorary president of the second eugenics conference.  The American movement received extensive funding from the Carnegie Institution and Rockefeller Foundation.

Hitler wrote to Grant, the author of *The Passing of the Great Race*, thanking him for the book and referred to it as "my Bible". In 1919 he joined the German Workers' Party. It seems likely that his interest in the eugenics movement motivated him to get involved in politics.  While most of the blame tends to be focused on him as an indvidual, it would be ignorant to not recognize that there was a large following that agreed with the message he was heading.
