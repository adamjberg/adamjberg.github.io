*Record scratch*

*Freeze Frame*

You're probably wondering how I got here. Here I'll share my story going from Computer Engineering student, to video game developer, to web developer, and finally to Chief Technology Officer at [Dubsado](https://www.dubsado.com/).

## Computer Engineering

Like countless others in software engineering, my journey starts with an obsession with video games. I became fascinated by the PlayStation 3's [Cell microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(microprocessor)) and the Folding@Home(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home#PlayStation_3) project that ran biomedical computations 20 times faster than PCs of that era. I needed to understand how it worked and wanted to learn more about the advances being made in processing power.

In 2010, I joined the Bachelor of Applied Science (Engineering) program at the University of British Columbia (UBC). At UBC, the first year courses for engineering are shared by everyone. The curriculum gives you a taste of all the different kinds of engineering: electrical, mechanical, civil, etc. At the end of your first year, you rank the disciplines you would like to enter and the programs select which students they would like to take on. I wasn't too worried about placing in electrical and computer engineering (ECE). It was openly discussed that mechanical and civil engineering were the competitive ones. I'd find out later most of the people that didn't get their first choice ended up in ECE.

### Co-op

At the end of your second year, you are given the choice to enter the co-op program. Having just been denied student loans, this became my path toward financing my education. Thankfully, I had already applied to be a Residence Advisor at the start of my second year and was at least somewhat comfortable with the job application process.

As a second year computer engineering student, I had just barely started to understand how to program in C. After a fairly generic first year, my second year had shared curriculum with the electrical engineers. For my projects and courses I had learned assembly, digital circuits, and built electromechanical devices. The coordinators of the program were incredibly helpful during this time. My coordinator encouraged me to apply for pretty much everything, without worrying about whether I'd actually enjoy the job. Her second pro tip was that there was less competition outside the Metro Vancouver area.

I likely sent out 20 to 30 applications, each with a customized cover letter. I had exactly one interview during the first round. A friendly man was on the line and he asked me some questions about my coursework and I told him about this Pong game I built in Java. Before I knew it, it was over. No dreaded whiteboard interview and no multi step process. At the time, placements were made using a ranking system. Students were required to rank anyone you interviewed with, but the employer didn't necessarily have to. 

I was convinced that I wouldn't get the job. The second round of applying would begin shortly. I was feeling exhausted and defeated from the 30 applications I had already filled out. After not hearing anything for a while, I planned to attend a job fair held by the Computer Science department. I got myself dressed up, printed some resumes, and rehearsed what I was going to say if I managed to actually speak to someone. I checked my email just before heading out and I found an offer from a company called iRok2 Media in Kelowna, BC.
