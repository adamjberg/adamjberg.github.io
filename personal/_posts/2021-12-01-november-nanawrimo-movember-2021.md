## NaNoWriMo

[NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) is National Novel Writing Month. I stumbled across NaNoWriMo in university, but initially wrote it off (see what I did there?) as not my cup of tea. I've been writing more and more lately and again stumbled upon a NaNoWriMo poster. I knew I didn't want to write a novel, but I figured I could slightly modify the terms to suit my needs.

The traditional NaNoWriMo challenge is to write 50,000 words of a brand new novel.  Instead of a novel, I loosened this to just 50,000 words of intentional blog posts. More specifically, I have been quite focused on techinical writing to help encourage myself and others to learn certain topics in software. I knew 50,000 would be near impossible so I instead decided to just get out as much as I could and see where that left me.  In future years, I can use this as a benchmark to know what is possible.

Below is a tally of my posts during the month and how many words each contained:

| Post      | Word Count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|   [The Night Technology Betrayed Me: A Halloween Horror Story](https://devtails.medium.com/the-night-technology-betrayed-me-a-halloween-horror-story-c85b91750835)    |    2395    |
|  [Bundling Your Node.js Express App with esbuild](https://medium.com/@devtails/bundling-your-node-js-express-app-with-esbuild-5aecc36c5047)  |    484     |
| Building My First Command Line Interface (CLI) with Rust | 1242
| How to Convert Audio From Wav to MP3 in Node.js Using FFMpeg | 387
| How to Convert Audio from wav to mp3 in JavaScript Using ffmpeg.wasm | 881
| How to Build a Note Taking Command Line Application With Rust: Part 1 | 1924
| How to Start Learning to Code | 658
| How to Build Your First HTML Page | 525
| Adding Interactivity to HTML With JavaScript | 1206
| How to Set Up Server Side Rendering (SSR) With React and esbuild | 1597
| **Total** | 11299

There are still quite a few pieces that are a work in progress, but these are ones that came together 100%.

To prevent myself from coming up with excuses I chose to just start writing on medium.com. I wrote [Bundling Your Node.js Express App with esbuild
](https://medium.com/p/5aecc36c5047) in surely no more than 20 minutes and posted to a couple of places.  It currently has 2,500 views which blew me away.

This was really quite motivating so I decided to try out another post. [Building My First Command Line Interface (CLI) with Rust](https://medium.com/p/b6beb9c284e0) is a recap of what I had learned so far about Rust. I've been telling myself to learn rust for what feels like a decade. Looking at it through the lens of writing a post, helped me narrow down my focus to a specific aspect - building a simple CLI tool.

This post again picked up more steam than I expected. It was featured on [this-week-in-rust.org](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) and [Geek Culture](https://medium.com/geekculture) reached out to me to publish in their publication.  This one currently sits with 3,700 views.

I tried my hand at a couple smaller articles to see if this was going to be a normal amount of traffic.  My next few posts only netted ~300 views. In the background I had started a larger tutorial on [how to use rust to build a note taking command line application](https://medium.com/p/34b9cd5be6b9). Once I finished, I submitted to [Level Up Coding](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/) - one of the top coding publications on Medium.  

After not hearing back for a week, I decided to just self publish this weekend.  Shortly aftwards they contacted me to let me know they added me as a writer to their publication.  I'm not sure if this post will make it in, but seems likely that I should be able to submit future ones to them.
