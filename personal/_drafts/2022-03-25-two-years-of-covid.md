4AM in Vancouver

It's 4AM in Vancouver and I can't sleep.  I went to bed at 9:30PM, so I guess I've slept 7 hours already.  Feeling like I wish I could just keep sleeping, but it's not happening.

I'm having so many thoughts that it's impossible to fall back asleep.  But sitting here to write it's challenging to put them into words.

It feels like I'm thinking and moving in slow motion.  I stare at my hands on top of my keyboard and see a white glow effect from the backlight of the keyboard.  I'm sitting in near darkness with the brightness of my laptop at its lowest.  My eyes strain a bit to look at the screen.

It's day three of what are probably COVID symptoms...

# Pandemic

Almost exactly two years ago the world shut itself down for the first time in my lifetime. I remember receiving an email telling me that my flight was cancelled and that I would get a refund.  There wasn't any information on when I might be able to get on a plane again.  

Like a bad dream we were all stuck at school in only our underwear or with our teeth falling out.  Except there was no waking up from this dream.  Instead we had to figure out how to deal with this thing called "the new normal".

I buckled myself in, locked the door, and stayed inside. For many, this was torture.  Weddings, birthdays, funerals, and eveything in between cancelled. But like a nocturnal animal at night, I awakened just as everyone went down for sleep.  

# Inside

This was one of the most reflective and transformative periods of my life.  The hustle and bustle of daily life had caught up to me.  I needed that time to collect my thoughts and forge a path forward.

I started writing this blog during this time, with my first [intro post](https://adam.xyzdigital.com/announcements/x-why-z-digital) in May 2020.  I rekindled my love for reading during this time and wrote about [NeuroTribes](https://adam.xyzdigital.com/arts/books/neurotribes-part-one-autism-as-a-spectrum) and [The Happiness Equation](https://adam.xyzdigital.com/arts/books/the-happiness-equation).

I was posting fairly regularly and quite content with life until I was struck with [COVID in September](https://adam.xyzdigital.com/personal/two-weeks-of-covid).  After a grueling two weeks, I slowly began to regain my life force. I still have yet to feel as good as I did prior to illness.

# Endemic

Early this year, B.C. announced that it would move towards a more "endemic" approach to COVID-19.  Mask mandates were dropped and most gathering restrictions were lifted. 

"Maybe this is the beginning of the end", I thought.  Only to get slammed by another COVID outbreak.  My brain slowed to a crawl and my body crawled into bed.
