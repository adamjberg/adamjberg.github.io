title:  A Day in the Life Without a Smart Phone

I just wrote about giving up my iPhone and using a feature phone as my daily driver. This post covers some first impressions since the transition - mostly focused on a day travelling internationally.

It's 6 AM, my alarm is doing its 80s techno thing. I'm tempted to hit snooze, but to be completely honest I'm not sure how.  I think I might need to set an entirely new alarm. Defeated (or saved?) by technology, I decide to get out of bed. 

My usual morning urge to check for notifications on my phone is already mostly a relic of the past. I know I'll find nothing interesting on my phone, so it stays on the nightstand. Instead of seeking some form of morning digital distraction, I'm already on my way to make breakfast. I ponder putting on some music, but remember there's nothing yet loaded on my phone and no other convenient way to put music on. 

I put on a kettle to make some tea and stand idle waiting for it to get hot. For once, the need to inject information into my brain doesn't exist. I've prepped a loose leaf rooibos tea (more on my disdain for caffeine some other time). The colors of the leaves and sound as they rattle around the metal container are much more vibrant than normal. 

I sense myself realizing that my level of awareness has heightened.  The last two nights have been filled with vivid dreams - something that hasn't happened in a long time. 

I pour my tea and bring my breakfast to the table.  I catch myself wondering if I should read the news. I quickly remember that the little device in my pocket would barely manage that task and so I carry on eating. It's quiet and peaceful.  I take note of my surroundings and how my food tastes.  

A memory of the previous night pops in to my mind of doing a little art tour in my apartment. The art on the walls called for my attention more than it ever really has.  I go around to each piece and just look.  Straightening frames that seem out of alignment and smile remembering the story behind each piece.

With breakfast out of the way it's time to prepare for a day of travel. I pull out my notebook to start figuring out what I'll need for the day ahead.  I have a COVID test booked at the airport, so I note the confirmation code down so I won't have troubles when I get there. For some reason, my online check-in didn't allow printing a boarding pass so I resign myself to getting one at the airport. 

The previous day I realized that my vaccine passport is no longer on my phone. I make sure to pack the printed copy that I had from a previous trip. 

I'm feeling good about having everything I need and then I remember I need to get to the airport somehow. The first thing that comes to mind is ordering an Uber. I no longer have the app, so I check to see if I can order one ahead of time from my computer.  I go to login to find that my password isn't saved on my computer - only on my phone's LastPass (who just recently ripped off every one of their customers by only allowing the free version to work on mobile or desktop). I log in on my computer and am able to use one of 3 "device switches" to get access to **my own data**. 

Now that I'm logged in I schedule an uber pickup. I worry that the pickup will be complicated, but figure I can check the computer to see where the driver is at to successfully meet.  When the time comes, the pickup goes relatively smoothly.

I arrive at the airport and head over for my COVID test.  I was told ahead of time that the results will only be given electronically.  I figure I won't have to show this more than once so I'll just use my iPad. 

I head to the food court to grab some food. Without a "fidget flicker" (smartphone), I find myself with nothing to do so I pull out my notebook.  I brainstorm a few app ideas and gather some other random thoughts that have been floating around for a while. 

I eventually check to confirm my test results came in. I see my email with a negative result. I wonder how simple it would be to forge this document. 

Finally I head over to the check-in. There's a big banner in front of Alaska Air with a QR code saying this thing must be completed before checking in.  I groan, as I pull out my laptop and go to the provided URL only to find that it's the same document I already filled out when checking in online.

Still wondering if I'm missing some magical step, I head to the check-in counter. I hand over my passport and am asked for my proof of vaccination and covid test.  Both are eyed over loosely before nodded away. I'm handed yet another form "US attestation" that I must fill out before boarding.  I peruse it and see that it's telling me that I need proof of vaccination and negative COVID test. 

Monitor down at the gate.
