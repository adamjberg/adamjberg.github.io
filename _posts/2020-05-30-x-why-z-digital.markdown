Below is a snapshot from 2003 using the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20030911171839/http://xyzdigital.com/).

The domain xyzdigital.com was acquired on August 25, 1999.  I still don't know the full story behind it (though that may one day change), but I do know it was originally purchased and hosted by [Network Solutions](https://www.networksolutions.com/) "The World's First Domain Provider". 

Whenever I was asked for an email address I would give out `adam@xyzdigital.com`.  Most people found this strange.  "Is that a real email", "What is is xyzdigital.com"
