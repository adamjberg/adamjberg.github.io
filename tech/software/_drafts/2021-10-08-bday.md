# 8 Minute Mile

In Middle School we used to have a semi-regular fitness test where we would run a mile around the school. I felt so cool for the portion of the run that was technically off school grounds. This was a long time ago, but I'm pretty sure the time we were supposed to target was below 8 minutes. Looking back, I can only assume that this run was supposed to be a mile run (my child brain did not fully encode much of this). 

I never made it under that 8 minute mark, despite playing soccer regularly for most of my life.  I was diagnosed with asthma at some point as a kid. This made running for long periods of time quite difficult as it would normally conclude with me coughing up a lung.  I was however reasonably good at sprinting short distances. This combined with me transitioning to playing goalie solidified the fact that I would never really build up the endurance to make that 8 minute mile.

From high school onward, I never really timed myself again. I probably had a decent period in 11th grade until I eventually pulled my hamstring. In university, my sport playing reduced to a weekly game of ultimate frisbee and eventually that fizzled into nothing by the time I graduated. I mustered the energy to start running at some point, eventually leading to a knee injury that had me nearly unable to walk.  That knee injury has persisted for roughly the last 5 years. Every so often I tell myself that this is the time that it's going to get better, and so far I've been regularly disappointed.

At the start of the week I decided that this is the week I do it - run an 8 minute mile.  Past attempts usually lead to severe knee pain in the 5 to 6 minute range or me simply not being fit enough to make it.  Monday I started with a goal of 10 minutes to prove to myself that I could at least survive running a mile.  Tuesday I set a goal of 9:30. Wednesday I did under 9. Thursday I did 8:30.  And today I succeeded in dipping below the 8 minute mark.

Why am I even writing about this? I've become a lot more reflective as I've gotten older.  One of the things that I've learned about myself is how effective setting incremental goals is.  At the start of the week I didn't believe I could run an 8 minute mile, but I was reasonably sure I should be able to do a 10 minute mile.  After making it to the end it became more clear to me that I still had some energy left that meant I could have run faster even if just for a small section.  

This is an approach I try to follow in all aspects of my life. Just because I can't do something today, does not mean I won't be able to do it tomorrow. 

# Personal Project Updates

If you know me, you know that I'm usually tinkering on some kind of software project. In the past these were usually Flash games.  Unfortunately, these have become near impossible to easily share nowadays thanks to the "death of flash".  Nowadays, I spend a fair bit of time building web apps that I find personally useful.  The two most notable ones being [engram](https://engramhq.xyz) and [kaizen](https://kaizen.place).
