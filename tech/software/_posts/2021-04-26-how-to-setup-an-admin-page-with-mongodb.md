title:  How to Setup an Admin Page With MongoDB
author: Adam Berg
---

The year is 2013 and you're looking to start a new SaaS application.  You've been following the latest trends and decide to go with [The MEAN Stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and).  It won't be until a few years later that you regret most of these decisions, before finally settling into the acceptance phase. While the development world shifts largely away from Angular and towards alternatives, MongoDB has carved itself a spot as one of the top NoSQL databases and will be around for the forseeable future.

Unfortunately, despite the countless tutorials you have resigned to using [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) or [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) to manage your data.  This post describes how to quickly setup an admin page using the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [djongo](https://github.com/nesdis/djongo) connector.
